# ManagerSpecials
Coding project for the interview process at PrestoQ

## Environment Requirements
This project uses:

* Java 8
* Kotlin 1.3.31
* Gradle 5.1.1
* Android Studio 3.4
* Android API 28

If your Android Studio installation is up to date, these requirements
should match what you already have installed. Older versions of Android
Studio, Kotlin, and Gradle will likely work, though you'll need to edit
the build.gradle files to get your project to compile.

## Project Setup
1) Clone the repo into your workspace directory. 
1) In Android Studio, click 'Open an existing Android Studio project'. 
1) Pick the cloned directory (not a project file).
1) Allow the automatic configuration to settle

You should now be able to build and deploy directly to an ADB-connected
device with the Run (green 'play' icon) button.
